# Installation

# Usage

CircTest is strongly recommended to work with the output of DCC: https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC, otherwise, you need to organise your data in the smae format as DCC outputs.

For a brief demonstration of usage, please refer to DCC page: https://github.com/dieterich-lab/DCC/blob/master/README.rst#test-for-host-independently-regulated-circrnas-with-circtest-package
